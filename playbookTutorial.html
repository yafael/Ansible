            <h2>Ansible Playbooks</h2>
            <p>Playbooks are the the basis for declaring configurations as well as orchestrating steps of any manual ordered process</p>
          </header>

          <br/>
          <h3>What does one look like?</h3>
          <p>Playbooks are written and expressed in YAML format.  They are designed to be more of a model of a configuration or a process rather than a program language.  This allows for easy human readablility by anyone.  No special coding skills are needed to create a playbook.</p>

          <h3>What is in one?</h3>
          <p>Each playbook is composed of one or more 'plays' in a list.  In the playbook file, each play is in its own task hash.  Each of these plays is run (in the order defined in the playbook) to perform a certain task.  A task is nothing more than a call to an ansible module.  These modules do the actual 'heavy lifting' needed to complete a task.  Ansible comes with many modules out of the box covering a wide range of tasks. Check them out <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/modules_by_category.html">here.</a></p>

          <br/>
          <h2>Basic Layout of a Play</h2>
          <h3>Host and Users</h3>
          <p>For each play, you get to choose which machines will be targets and what remote user will complete the tasks.  The hosts hash defines which machines will be targeted while the remote_user hash is the name of the user account.</p>
          <pre><code class='yaml'>hosts: webservers
remote_user: root</code></pre>

          <h3>Task List</h3>
          <p>Each play is comprised of a list of tasks.  All tasks that will be executed during this play are defined as a list item in the 'tasks' hash. Each of these tasks are executed in order, one at a time, against all machines targeted, before moving on to the next task.</p>
          <p>Each task should have a name that is human readable.  This name is displayed during the running of the task.  Below this is the task itself.  Modules that are needed to perform the task are added to this list element and any corresponding arguments are added for each module.</p>
          <pre><code class="yaml">tasks:
  - name: make sure apache is running
    service: name=httpd state=started</code></pre>

          <h3>Handlers</h3>
          <p>Handlers can respond to changes on the remote system by running operations defined by the user.  These actions are triggered at the end of each block of tasks in a play when notified of a change by a module.  These actions are listed in the notify section of a task and are called handlers</p>
          <p>Handlers are lists of tasks and are referenced by a globally unique name.  For a handler to run, it must be notified by a notifier.  Handlers are defined as a list item in a handlers hash.  Each handler has a name it can be called by, the action it performs, and can have a generic topic it listens for.</p>
          <pre><code class="yaml">handlers:
    - name: restart memcached
      service: name=memcached state=restarted
      listen: "restart web services"
    - name: restart apache
      service: name=apache state=restarted
      listen: "restart web services"

tasks:
    - name: restart everything
      command: echo "this task will restart the web services"
      notify: "restart web services"</code></pre>

          <h3>Running a Playbook</h3>
          <p>It's very easy to run a playbook.  In the command line, use ansible-playbook with the name of your playbook YAML file and any other flags.  This will start the execution of the playbook</p>
          <pre><code class="yaml">ansible-playbook myPlaybook.yml</code></pre>

          <h2>Example Playbook</h2>
          <pre><code>---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
  - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
    yum: name=httpd state=latest
  - name: write the apache config file
    template: src=/srv/httpd.j2 dest=/etc/httpd.conf
    notify:
    - restart apache
    handlers:
    - name: restart apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted

- hosts: databases
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
  - name: ensure postgresql is at the latest version
    yum: name=postgresql state=latest
  - name: ensure that postgresql is started
    service: name=postgresql state=started
</code></pre>

          <br/>
          <h2>More Features</h2>
          <p>Above is just the very beginning of how to set up and run a playbook.  It is already a powerful tool, but there is still a lot more that can be used to customize a playbook to fit your specific needs as well as simplify each task.<br/>
          More features include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Variables</li>
            <li>Include statments to include plays and tasks from other files</li>
            <li>Templating</li>
            <li>Conditional statments and Loops</li>
            <li>Blocks and Error Handling</li>
            <li>Strategies to help organize when each task is run on each machine</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can learn more about playbooks <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html">here</a></p>

          <h2>Ansible Galaxy</h2>
          <p>
          <h3>What is Ansible Galaxy?</h3>
            <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/">Ansible Galaxy</a> is a way to expand you playbooks through the use of community created "roles" which act as premade code segments for your playbooks.
            <br/>

          <h3>Example:</h3>
            Lets pull an example "role" from Ansible Galaxy <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/mysql/">such as this one</a> This role (called geerlingguy.mysql) will install
            mysql or mariadb on a given system or server.
            <br/>
            To install this "role" we use the following command:

            <pre><code class="yaml">ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.mysql</code></pre>

            now that the role is installed we can call it through a playbook such as this:

            <pre><code class="yaml">- hosts: db-servers
  become: yes
  vars_files:
    - vars/main.yml
  roles:
    - { role: geerlingguy.mysql }</code></pre>
            This will call the role and perform it's "action" from the playbook, an example of a variable file that would also be required is listed here:
            <pre><code class="yaml">mysql_root_password: super-secure-password
mysql_databases:
  - name: example_db
    encoding: latin1
    collation: latin1_general_ci
mysql_users:
  - name: example_user
    host: "%"
    password: similarly-secure-password
    priv: "example_db.*:ALL"
              </code></pre>
              However each "Role" will have different variables to be specified, check a "roles" documentation for specifics.
              <br/>
